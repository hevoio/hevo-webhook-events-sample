This Repository contains boilerplate code for you to start using the Hevo Webhook Events feature

At this time we have added Express (Node Js) and Flask (Python) servers.


These servers serve as a foundation for building webhook event handlers and integrating them with Hevo. 

Feel free to explore the repository and utilize the provided code as a starting point. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/hevoio/hevo-webhook-events-sample/issues)!
